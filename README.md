# Cryptography Tool: AES and RSA Encryption/Decryption

This Python tool demonstrates how to use AES (symmetric encryption) and RSA (asymmetric encryption) algorithms for securely encrypting and decrypting text. The tool also demonstrates the importance of secure key management for encryption and decryption operations.

## Features
- AES Encryption/Decryption using a symmetric key.
- RSA Encryption/Decryption using public/private key pairs.
- Key generation for RSA with secure padding and hashing.
- Demonstrates the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms.

## Prerequisites
Before using the script, you need to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome cryptography
